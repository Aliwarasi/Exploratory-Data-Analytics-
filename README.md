# Exploratory-Data-Analytics-
This project provides a practical guide to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), showcasing how to transform raw data into actionable insights. It covers essential steps such as data exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using various techniques to uncover patterns and relationships for improved decision-making.

This project helps users uncover hidden insights in data, guiding informed decisions and strategic planning. It demonstrates how well-executed EDA can enhance data understanding, making complex datasets more accessible and interpretable.

To get started, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore the sample data and apply the EDA techniques demonstrated.

For assistance, check the documentation provided in the repository. If you encounter issues or have questions, use the GitHub Issues tab to report them. We also welcome your contributions, feedback, and suggestions for improvements.

This project was created by me with the help of a team at FemsTech Worldwide, including Mr. Alham O. Hotaki. Contributions are welcome, and you can contribute by submitting pull requests or participating in discussions through GitHub
